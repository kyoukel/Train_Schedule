# Firebase | Train Scheduler
    
## Overview
Create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. 

> This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

## Setup
> Use Firebase to store data, GitHub to backup your project, and GithHub Pages to host your finished site.
    
## Instructions - App must suit this basic spec:

**When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:**
- [x] Train Name
- [x] Destination
- [x] First Train Time -- in `military time`
- [x] Frequency -- in `minutes`
- [x] Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time
- [x] Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times

##Happy Scheduling!
